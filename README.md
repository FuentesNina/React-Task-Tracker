# Task Tracker Using React Framework

I chose to do this project in order to get familiar with the react Framework. I was following the React Crash Course from Traversy Media (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7ejDZ8SWv8&t=5024s&ab_channel=TraversyMedia).

My intent was to base myself on the provided steps while making the project my own. Changes made to the original tutorial are meant to help me get a deeper understanding of the methods.

Intended changes at the start of the project were:
- custom styling/css
- task vs events with task title and multi-line description (vs. event name and date)
- collapsible view of task description (showing 1 line of the description in standard view)
- "show completed tasks" option

Future changes that could be incorporated once the initial app is created (to gain further knowledge of web developement):
- option to create an account and login
- store all info in database with data on date/time of task creation and completion
